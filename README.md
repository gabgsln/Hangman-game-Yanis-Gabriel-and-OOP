# Hangman-game-Yanis-Gabriel-and-OOP

We have two assigment one game is the hangman game known by all and the game will give you 6 tries that you have to guess a random word , you can guess the word directly or letter by letter if you are wrong more than 6 time is game over and you will see the drawing of the hangman completing withint the amount of errors increasing , and you also be able to visualize the letter your already guessed that will help you remind , and also to see the word changing in function of the guessed letter if there a present in the word and there is also a score based on your performance that can evolve posittevely and negatively if you are correct or wrong

For the technical part what we did was first create a selected word wich is randomly choiced by the lenght wich is inputed by the player and then this word will be seen like a list of characters and the player can guess the letters in uppercase so the program is a lot of if statement has we have to print a lot of things during the game like the number of  errors  m the guessed letter ect . So the most difficult part was how to deal with the word by length , the rest of the program is mostly interfaace and rules that make the game more enjoyjable also a difficult part was to make the drawing evolve by the number of tries by the index of the list by including each drawing in a list
